Need to be able to specify offset somehow.

  * zero offset for continuous data
  * zero offset for polar coordinates
  * smaller offset as dimensions increase
  
Extend formula specification to allow weighting variable on left-hand side

Add spline function which automatically picks direction based on aspect ratio.

Rename treemap to squares (?)
