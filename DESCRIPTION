Title: product plots for R
Description: A new framework for visualising tables of counts, proportions and 
    probabilities. We call our framework product plots, alluding to the 
    computation of area as a product of height and width, and the statistical 
    concept of generating a joint distribution from the product of conditional 
    and marginal distributions. The framework, with extensions, is sufficient 
    to encompass over 20 visualisations previously described in fields of 
    statistical graphics and infovis, including bar charts, mosaic plots, 
    treemaps, equal area plots and fluctuation diagrams.
